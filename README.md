The easiest way to create adapters! You can add a lot of different layouts and models. This library avoid all the boilerplates needed to create a list for your application.

Highly inspired on [Renderers][10] and [RecyclerViewRenderers][11], thanks for [Alexrs95][12].

Support
-------

This library works on API 10, but not yet tested.

How to use
----------

You can use [this sample ][2] to understand this library. I will document soon.

Import dependency
--------------------------------

This library uses appcompat-v7:22.1.0.

But why not add in MavenCentral?
Because it is so much bureaucratic.

JitPack is there and is the future!

Into your build.gradle:

```groovy

repositories {
  maven {
    url "https://jitpack.io"
  }
}

dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.ppamorim:recyclerrenderers:v1.15.1'
}
```
